# E-Waste Management Capstone Project

This web-based application was developed as part of a diploma capstone project on e-waste management.

## Overview

As part of this project, I was responsible for developing both the **front-end** and **back-end** components of the system.

### Front-End Development
- I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build web pages and interactive forms.
- The forms allow users to **fill out reports** and **view past submissions**.
- I implemented **form validation** to ensure clean and accurate data submission.
- The design is user-friendly, with a responsive layout to enhance the user experience.

### Back-End Development
- I utilized **PHP** to retrieve data from the **phpMyAdmin** database.
- The data is displayed dynamically on the web page, including visual representation using a **bar chart**.
  
### Database Management
- I used **SQL** to design and manage the database through **phpMyAdmin**.
- Tables were created to store and retrieved **e-waste reports** effectively.
